# 👋 Hey there! I'm **Santiago Echeverri Duque**  

🚀 **DevOps Engineer | Site Reliability Engineer | Cloud Specialist**

I’m passionate about designing **resilient, scalable, and automated systems** that make software delivery smoother, faster, and more reliable.  
For me, technology is not just about tools — it’s about **creativity, optimization, teamwork, and problem-solving**. I love turning complex challenges into elegant, automated solutions that improve both performance and collaboration.  

☁️ My main playgrounds are **cloud infrastructure, automation pipelines, and system reliability**. Whether it’s deploying on AWS, improving CI/CD workflows, or reducing toil through smart automation — I’m always chasing better efficiency and stability.  

When I’m not deep in YAML files or debugging production systems, you’ll probably find me:  
🎮 immersed in video games,  
✈️ exploring new places,  
💪 hitting the gym, or  
📺 catching up on my favorite anime.
